# StockViz
Stock visualiation interface for MIT 6.813/6.831.

## Sass
Install Sass by running `gem install sass`.

Once you have Sass installed, run `sass --sourcemap=none --watch ./scss:./` in the parent directory. This will generate a css file every time you save your scss file.

## TODO
- clear search after click
- alphabetize new stocks when added to compare
- checkmark on search results (clicking these should remove them from the list)
- colorcode stocks
- plots
- padding on hover in table?
- extra line when first item in table is missing
- icon in change column
